Create an application for a small Diner.

In this Diner, water is available at no charge, but it has to be ordered. Customers may also make special requests for their salad. The application accepts as input the salad and drink selections. The user (manager) of the Diner would like to have options for showing the total cost of the order, displaying the current order selections, or allowing the customer to change their minds about each of the selections.

Menu Options 
**File**
> Place the Order – displays the current order (salad, drink, special request and water) and the 
total price of the order.
> Clear the Order – deselects all the user selections on the GUI and sets all of the individual 
selections back to their defaults.
> Display the Order – displays the current order
> Exit – closes the application

**Edit**
> Menu Selection – displays a message indicating that the salad menu selection is cleared, clears 
the menu selection and deselects the selected menu item.
> Drink - displays a message indicating that the drink selection is cleared, clears the drink selection 
and deselects the selected drink.
> Special Request - displays a message indicating that the special request selection is cleared, 
clears the textField if a value is typed.
